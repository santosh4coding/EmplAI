## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses system via `/api/login` endpoint
2. OIDC provider (Replit) handles authentication
3. User session created in PostgreSQL with role assignment
4. Frontend receives authenticated user context
5. Role-based UI components render appropriate interface

### AI Assistant Flow
1. User submits query through chat interface
2. Message sent to `/api/ai/chat` with user context
3. OpenAI API processes query with role-specific system prompt
4. AI response includes intent classification and suggested actions
5. Chat history stored in database for continuity

### Queue Management Flow
1. Patient requests token through kiosk or staff interface
2. System generates unique token with department prefix
3. QR code created with embedded patient and appointment data
4. Token added to department-specific queue with priority calculation
5. Real-time updates broadcast to staff dashboards

### Appointment Workflow
1. Patient books appointment via AI assistant or direct interface
2. System checks doctor availability and prevents double-booking
3. Appointment stored with patient, doctor, and department associations
4. Automated notifications sent to relevant parties
5. Queue token automatically generated on appointment day
